# Cipher Vault in C++

This project implements various classical encryption and decryption algorithms in C++. The ciphers include:

1. **Caesar Cipher**: Shift-based encryption.
2. **Vigen√®re Cipher**: Keyword-based encryption.
3. **Atbash Cipher**: Simple character reversal.
4. **Polyalphabetic Cipher**: Multi-key encryption.
5. **Rail Fence Cipher**: Zigzag transposition.
6. **Simple Columnar Transposition**: Rearrangement of characters based on a keyword.

## Features
- Supports both encryption and decryption for all ciphers.
- Interactive CLI for easy testing.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshk49/cipher_vault_cpp.git
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ cipher.cpp -o cipher_vault
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./cipher_vault
